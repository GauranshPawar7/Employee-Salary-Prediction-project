# Employee-Salary-Prediction-project

📌 Project Description
The Employee Salary Prediction Project is a machine learning-based solution designed to estimate an employee’s salary based on various attributes such as education, experience, job title, and location. This model leverages historical employee data to build predictive models that can assist HR departments and hiring managers in making data-driven decisions.

With proper feature engineering and model selection, this project aims to reduce human bias in salary estimation and increase transparency and fairness in recruitment and compensation planning.
